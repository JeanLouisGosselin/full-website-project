		<p>
		I was born in Montreal, Canada, in 1978. I started as a musician, having studied in several music schools in Canada, France and the UK.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		I freelanced as a musician and conductor (having graduated from the <span><a href="http://www.ram.ac.uk/" >Royal Academy of Music</a></span> of London in 2004), taught in many schools as a 
		cover teacher for <span><a href="http://www.destinationeducation.net/" > Destination Education</a></span> and explored the world of marketing with 
		Boosey & Hawkes music publishers in London. All in all, I have much experience in working and collaborating with people of different backgrounds.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		In the last 5 years I have developed a real passion for computer programming and web designing, having first studied C, C++, HTML, CSS and 
		JavaScript independently, before undertaking a full-time BSc in computer science (with games technology) at <span><a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/">
		 City, University of London</a></span> in September 2016. 
		This passion has also led me to take on the position of freelance teacher for <span><a href="http://www.geekykids.co.uk/" >Geeky Kids</a></span>, a programming
		club for children of all ages based in London.
